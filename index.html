            <p>Hi, I'm Ryan. Throughout high school I led the software side of a 
            robotics team and worked a software engineering internship at a startup 
            company using Python. I also have an Oracle certification from having a lot 
            of experience with Java. I have recently become more interested in low level 
            programming and cybersecurity, doing projects with C++ and working with the 
            Linux operating system, although I am also interested in working with 
            artificial intelligence.<p>
