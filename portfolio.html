                    <p>I worked with two other people on this project, using Microsoft SQL Server and Sveltekit to crate a
                    relational database and web application. This project serves as the main tool for editing the Ink Magazine,
                    as well as the place for users to submit works and editors to review works.</p>

                    <p>I worked by myself in a linear algebra course to create a terminal based program that took user input and performed various
                    calculations on matrices. Some of these calculations included finding the inverse of a matrix, finding distances
                    between points/lines/planes in 3d space, and the ordinary least squares regression algorithm.</p>
